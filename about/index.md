<h1> <p align="center">About</p></h1>

Todd is a technical Linchpin with a long term unrealized goal of automating and training himself out of a job. This quest for unemployment started with working hard to realize the perfection of the **lazy sysadmin**. At the same time he attempted **TKT** ( Total Knowledge Transfer ) as a Linux/Open Source advocate and teacher to the technical and becoming-technical people around him.

Todd's efforts to find better and faster ways to obsolescence lead him to the Cloud, Devops and IT automation. With tools like Ansible or Saltstack in a cloud environment the employment guarantee provided by being responsible for physical hardware was eliminated.  And now that servers could be deployed and made ready for production with a single command, his hopes of unemployment soared.

Unfortunately it was not to be.  The rise of Microservice Architecture meant that formerly stable Infrastructure As Code had to be updated and committed much more frequently and rapidly changing application dependencies strained IAC tooling's ability to keep up.   But Todd was not deterred and Service Discovery was found.  Soon the production environments were able to dynamically react to change and yet another employment enhancer was terminated.

But the testing environments were still an anchor of employment.  Engineers were daily changing branches on staging servers and wanting to add or modify the dependencies of that service.  And despite Todd's best efforts their knowledge/ability was not quite sufficient in many cases to make these complex changes. Todd was sure that **there's an app for that** and his searching quickly lead to the crowning technology: ChatOps.  If he can not successfully replace himself by transferring all knowledge and expertise to other carbon based life forms, maybe he could split that transfer between humans and a friendly neighborhood chatbot. This effort has met with huge initial success, particularly in relation to providing developers with motivation through a constant supply of canine images ( **pug me** ).  But as Hubot's abilities grow and developers self-discover how Hubot can help them in their daily development efforts, the future of unemployment is brighter than ever.
