As a long time technology worker I know one of the fundamental truths: I don't know it all and I cant know it all.  And so I consume the internet.  I have read hundreds of blogs and googled thousands of subjects.   I do this to find answers to specific problems.  I do this to keep up with the technology world: to learn more about a piece of software, a development methodology, a DevOps best practice.  And for much of my time in technology I did this as a consumer only.  I listened to the conversation but I did not speak.

But that no longer works for me.  It takes a village to raise a technology worker.  The content that people have created has helped me be a better technology worker and to find critical information during outages to get things working again and keep my company, and therefore my source of income, alive.  And so I decided to join the voices.  I still listen a lot, but I also speak.  And one of the ways I speak is through this blog.

I write in hopes that what I say can help others in the technology community, that my voice is one of the many that people who need answers can turn to.
