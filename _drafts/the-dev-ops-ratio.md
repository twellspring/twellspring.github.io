title: the dev ops ratio
---

I spent 15 minutes with google looking at measurement and metrics terms used in business.  I found a whole lot of them.   Here is a small sample:

* performance metrics
* key metrics
* operational metrics
* financial ratios
* profitability ratios
* current ratio
* staffing ratios
* ratio analysis 
* data driven business
* data driven decision making
* productivity
* SMART goals

So it is safe to say business likes metrics and measurement.  I think it is also safe to say that people in general do not like to be measured.  Some people do not like it because they are afraid of being measured correctly.  Others do not like it because they will be measured incorrectly.




What should the dev ops ratio be

theoretical 0:0
practical :::
depends on where you are in the lifecycle
higher if early and trying to implement everything.

I have been reading about the Dev/Ops ratio.
