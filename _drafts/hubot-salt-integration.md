title: Hubot Saltstack Integration

used http
I used our proprietary rest salt API ( we created so people integrating to salt did not have to understand salt and to allow me to setup custom commands to give back specific information that is not available from a single salt command or information formatted in a particlar way), but same method works if you have the saltstack API running.
